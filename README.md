# 12 Bit Synchronous Counter
In this project we design and implement a 12-bit synchronous counter with a parallel load feature.
The counter is controlled by a clock signal and incorporates a synchronous reset, enabling prioritized reset and load operations. 
The design supports two primary modes of operation: up-counting and down-counting, which are controlled by an input signal. 
A parallel load feature allows the counter to load a user-defined 12-bit value when activated. We also verify the code using directed and layered verification. 
Finally, we synthesize the circuit and design the layout in Innovus. We also optimize the circuit to increase its cost effectiveness
